# National Weather Service Weewx Driver

I am temporarily living on my college's campus and wanted to emulate the weather site I had [running at home](https://wx.millhousen.com/), but I am too cheap to buy another weather station.

My [Purdue Weather](https://wx.purdue.one/) site is using this NWS driver.

This is my solution.
